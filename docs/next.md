## What's next?

### Upcoming features
There might be some ideas for useful and reasonable extensions.
- **Multi-language support**: Ensure the theme switcher supports multiple languages if the application is 
internationalized.
- **Animation options**: Add animation options for transitioning between themes to provide a smoother user experience.
- **Accessibility options**: Provide options to adjust the theme for better accessibility, such as high contrast modes 
or larger fonts.
- **Theme synchronization**: Allow users to synchronize their selected theme preferences across multiple devices if the 
application is used across devices.
- **Theme Presets**: Offer a set of more pre-defined theme presets, giving users a quick way to change the look and feel of 
the application.
